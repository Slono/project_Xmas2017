# project_Xmas2017
This repo is for my Upskilled project Xmas2017
The project is for my assignment with Upskilled training course - Certificate IV in IoT
The project is written in Python2 code
The project is built on Raspberry Pi 3B hardware platform using a breadboard, an LCD display, 3 LEDs and a matrix keyboard
The project uses loops and iterations and also imports classes from existing modules of code written by Adeept
*** Credits to Adeept for LCD and Matrix keyboard code ***
A user is prompted to enter a 4-digit year (e.g. 2020) in matrix keyboard which is displayed on LCD
The program then compares the input with "2017" and calculates the difference in years
LCD then displays the difference in years and a message depending on whether the input is more or less than 2017 as an integer value
If the user inputs "2017" then 3 LEDs mounted on breadboard connected to Raspberry Pi run in sequence imitating Christmas lights and 
  creating a pleasurable user experience
After each cycle the program prompts the user to either continue or exit thereby presenting a user-friendly interface and graceful exit
